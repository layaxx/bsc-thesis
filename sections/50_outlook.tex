% What can be improved?
% Possible improvements:
% Take expected effects into account when choosing shot instead of only best fitting case
% Take distance between predicates into account when calculating case fit
% Better evaluation of Shots (What is a good shot?)
% Better effects detection

% Key Takeaways?

Because \ac{CBR} does not require complete knowledge, it could proof helpful in the Novelty Track of the AIBirds Competition, where objects with unknown properties are part of the challenge.

% score cases based on distance between relations, not just matched/violated
% add weights to relations
% add confidence to cases
