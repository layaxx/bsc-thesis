\subsection{Case-Based Reasoning}
Case-Bases Reasoning (CBR) is a method that dates back to the 1980s. It works similarly to how humans operate: Confronted with a novel situation, humans tend to think of similar situations they encountered in the past and try to adapt their previous solution to handle the new scene. Cases therefore typically consist of a description of a problem and a solution. They do not always have to be positive, i.e. show a potential solution, but can also be used to avoid mistakes by providing examples of what not to do in a given situation \cite{Kolodner1992}.

A typical process for \ac{CBR} consists of three steps: Case Retrieval, Adaptation, and Evaluation.\cite{Kolodner1992}
Confronted with a situation that needs to be solved, a database of known cases is queried and the case that best matches the problem is retrieved. A case consists of at least a description of the situation in which it is applicable and a solution for the problem. Usually situations are similar but not identical, thus the solution may need to be adapted to fit the new situation. The adapted solution can then be executed and its effects can be used to evaluate and potentially update the case.


Recently, CBR has been used in medical fields\cite{medical1, medical2} and robotics\cite{QCBR}, but also for language models \cite{text, text2}. % TODO: citation needed

\subsection{Qualitative Representations and Reasoning}
Unlike quantitative representations, qualitative representations try to abstract from actual values, thus increasing generalizability.
