% What is CBR?
% What is Angry-birds?
% What is AI-Birds?


\subsection{Previous Work}
In previous work, we devised a strategy to use Case-based reasoning to improve the performance of the agent. This strategy used a quantitative approach. Similarity between situations was judged based on position and size of objects.


\subsection{Goals \& Approaches}

Now the goal is to replace this with a qualitative solution.
Instead of absolute positions, relations between objects shall be considered when determining applicability of cases.

The main objective will consist of figuring out, which set of relations is sufficient for this task. Basis for this is a minimal implementation of an AIBirds Agent, that uses only the CBR strategy and performs a random 
% or semi random
shot if no applicable case can be found. 
This will allow for easy comparison between CBR implementations without interference from previously devised strategies.
