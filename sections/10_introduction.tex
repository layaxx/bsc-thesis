\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Angry Birds is physics-based puzzle game where the player has to hit every target (``pig'') with a set number of ballistic projectiles (``birds'') in order to clear a level and gain score.
Targets may be hidden behind objects, most of which can be moved or destroyed when hit.

While humans are generally able to achieve good scores on levels, this is not a trivial task for computers.
Creating an agent capable of doing this is the main goal of AIBIRDS, a yearly competition that started in 2012.\cite{Renz2015AIBIRDSTA}

This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of a qualitative case-based reasoning strategy for such an agent, with the goal of providing alternatives to current strategies and potentially improve scoring performance.
