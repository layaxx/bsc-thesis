Basis for this is a minimal implementation of an AIBirds Agent, that uses only the CBR strategy and performs a semi-random shot if no applicable case can be found.
This will allow for easy comparison between CBR implementations without interference from previously devised strategies.
The main goal here is to find a configuration, i.e. a subset of the qualitative predicates, for which the agent achieves the highest score on a set of AngryBirds levels.

After performing a shot derived from a CBR strategy, the result will be used to refine the underlying case.
This is supposed to enable determining the relevancy of relations between objects to replicability of cases.

The general flow of CBR will look like this: After a successful shot, a new case will be created or an existing one will be updated. When looking for shots to execute, the database of cases can be scanned for matching cases and a plan for a shot can be generated for every match.
