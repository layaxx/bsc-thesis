The main idea behind incorporating CBR in AngryBirds is to save interesting shots for future use. Therefore shots that directly target pigs are of little interest and are not saved to the database.
To increase the chance of finding unusual shots, the agent was modified to perform shots at random objects. For rectangular objects, the shots are aimed at either one, two or three thirds of the objects height instead of the center.
