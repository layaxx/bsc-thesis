To ensure comparability, settings must be the same between runs.
The level set consists of 21 levels, that have been used in the past to evaluate domino strategies. On average, the levels consist of 40.6667 entities (min: 12, max: 68, median: 36). An entity is an object than can be affected by a shot, e.g. a block of ice or a pig, but not a hill or a bird.

The median level contains four pigs and four birds.

The distribution of materials and shapes, which will become more important later, can be seen in figure % TODO: add figure
the structure of the levels can be seen in the Appendix % TODO add screenshot of debug tool
