To ensure comparability, settings must be the same between runs.
The level set consists of 21 levels, that have been used in the past to evaluate domino strategies. On average, the levels consist of 40.67 entities (min: 12, max: 68, median: 36). An entity is an object than can be affected by a shot, e.g. a block of ice or a pig, but not a hill or a bird.

The median level contains four pigs and four birds.

The distribution of materials and shapes, which are important for determining the number of possible configurations of a case, can be seen in figure \ref{fig:objects-in-levels}. The structure of the levels can be seen in the \ref{fig:levels}.
