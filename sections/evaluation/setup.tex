To ensure comparability, settings must be the same between runs.
The level set consists of 21 levels, that have been used in the past to evaluate domino strategies. They have been selected for the evaluation set because they include some instances of similar object configurations in different levels while still being diverse.
On average, the levels consist of 40.67 entities (min: 12, max: 68, median: 36). An entity is an object than can be affected by a shot, e.g. a block of ice or a pig, but not a hill or a bird.

The level set contains on average (median) four pigs and four birds per level.The distribution of materials and shapes of the objects can be seen in figure \ref{fig:objects-in-levels}. This is relevant to the analysis of the number of possible configurations of a case with hard constraints, as discussed in Section \ref{subsec:experimental-applicability}.
The structure of the levels can be seen in the \ref{fig:levels}.
